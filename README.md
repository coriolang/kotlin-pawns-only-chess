## About
Chess is a very popular game, but over time even the classic chess rules may become tiresome. The good news is that there are hundreds of variants. One of them is Pawns-only chess. In this game players should move their pawns to the opposite side of the board or capture all opposite pawns to win. In this project, I was create a game intended for two players.
